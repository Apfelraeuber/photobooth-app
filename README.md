# Photobooth Imageserver
This small python imageserver allows to use an arducam autofocus camera in the protobooth project.
The imageserver controls camera's autofocus, handles led signaling when a photo is taken and streams live video to photobooth.

The booth is made from 3d printed parts, [see the documentation over here](https://github.com/mgrl/photobooth-3d).
